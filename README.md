# round-robin-elo

ELO-based round robin tournament system.

## Outline

This is a tournament format designed to run many simultaneous games
possible, maximize the competitive level of the games (games should be
between people who are close in skill), allow organizers to control
tournament length, and work fairly.

It uses ELO ratings, updated throughout the tournament, as the
underlying mechanism of match-making and tournament rankings.

## Method

The tournament is run as a series of round-robin rounds. Every player
plays in every round, unless there's an odd number of players in which
case a single bye player needs to be selected for each round. (The bye
selection method is outside the scope of this system)

Matches for each round are determined using a matching algorithm based
on ELO score - it randomly divides the players into two equal groups
and attempts to match each group member with the closest-ranked player
in the other group, while disfavoring repeated games with the same
opponent.

After each round, ELO scores are updated based on the results of the
games.

Tournaments can choose the number of rounds they'd like to run. The
trade-off is increasing the number of rounds reduces the impact of
luck while increasing the length of the tournament.

It's also suggested that tournaments use the top 4 ranked competitors
at the end of the rounds and use some form of playoffs to
determine final tournament results.

## Examples

We start with a set of players, and for the purposes of our simulation
we assign them a "true" skill level that will be used to figure out
who wins games.

```clojure
(def player-true-skill
  {"swatllama" 1200
   "Frosty" 1100
   "Acuerta" 1050
   "Honzik" 1070
   "Redon" 1020
   "Raffael" 980
   "lagout" 950
   "neon" 900
   "r3hab" 850
   "Fear" 800})
```

Again, the true skill is present for simulation purposes only. This
number does not exist when the system is used for real tournaments.

We assign a set of starting ELO ranks to all the players, based on
their performance in the all vs. all game. We have defined our ELO
algorithm to have a max delta of 50 points per game, so we have a
50-point spread in the initial rankings.

```clojure
(def player-rankings
  {"swatllama" 1025
   "Frosty" 1020
   "Acuerta" 1015
   "neon" 1010
   "Raffael" 1005
   "Honzik" 995
   "Redon" 990
   "Fear" 985
   "r3hab" 980
   "lagout" 975})
```

We then simulate a tournament lasting for 4 rounds using this player data:

```clojure
(def players
  (map (fn [[name ranking]]
         (player/new-player name ranking (get player-rankings name)))
         player-true-skill))

(round-robin-elo.simulate/simulate-tourney players 4)
```

Here is an example of the output of one simulation:
